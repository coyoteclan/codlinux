Unlike CoD 2, CoD 1/UO require some environment variables to be set to run through wine (see [this](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=36969)).
To run the games, you need a script. But using scripts is a little inconvenient. This wrapper allows you to run these games easily and also sets up default app (itself) for opening `iw1x://` uri scheme.
